# Friends.test version history

## friends.test 0.99.22

- `friends_test()` is now the entry point for both branches: its `mode` argument
  selects `"ks"` (the default) or `"bic"` and passes the remaining arguments on.
  Passing an argument that belongs to the other mode is an error.
- The Kolmogorov-Smirnov branch, previously `friends_test()` itself, is now
  `friends_test_ks()`. `friends_test_bic()` is unchanged. All three are exported.
- The row-wise stages of both branches now go through one internal driver
  instead of a serial and a parallel copy each, and the two step fitters share
  their search and their assembly. No result changes.
- Worker library paths are only set when they differ from the ones already in
  effect. Setting them costs about 34 microseconds against 0.2 for reading
  them, and it was being done once per row: a pass over the 15176 by 8 example
  matrix drops from 2.08 to 1.58 seconds.
- `best_step_fit_bic()` no longer raises an error when every rank in a row is
  tied and `prior.to.have.friends` is 1; it reports no friends, as it already
  did for every other prior.
- `cli.progress_show_after`, which `.progress = TRUE` sets, is now restored on
  exit instead of being left changed in the user's session.
- `max.friends.n` no longer accepts the abbreviations `"al"` and `"a"`, nor
  `NA`. `"all"` and `NULL` still mean every column, and a number still means a
  number.
- The startup message is only printed in an interactive session. The reviewer
  pointed out that a workflow attaching dozens of packages does not want a
  line from each of them; scripts, vignettes and build machines now see
  nothing.
- `unif_ks_test()` computed its test twice, once on ranks mapped to the unit
  interval and once on the raw scale, and threw the first result away. The two
  are the same test, so the duplicate is gone. It also jittered the ranks a
  second time while keeping the first jitter's maximum as the upper end of the
  support, which could put a point outside the declared support.
- `uniform.max` is replaced by `uniform.null`, which names the whole
  convention rather than one endpoint. `"observed"`, the default, keeps the
  present behaviour: the support is the row's own range, so the test is
  invariant to where the profile sits and a row spread evenly over part of the
  scale still counts as uniform. `"continuity"` and `"randomized"` fix the
  support at the whole rank scale instead; they are calibrated, but treat
  concentration as evidence. They need `max.possible.rank`.
- The `"c"` setting of `uniform.max` is withdrawn rather than renamed. It took
  the lower end of the support from the data and the upper end from the rank
  scale, which is not a null hypothesis: measured against uniform rows it
  rejected at 0.066 instead of 0.05 with eight columns, and at 0.084 with
  three.
- The documentation of `.progress` said it enabled the text progress bar of the
  chosen `BPPARAM`. It does not: that bar has been off since 0.99.20 and the
  package draws its own. What you actually see now says so, including that
  neither kind renders when the output is redirected rather than shown in a
  terminal.
- The validity messages of `step_fit_ln_likelihoods()` name the argument they
  are about. The first one used to refer to a `Rows_no` parameter, which the
  function has never had, and two different problems shared the message
  "Ranks are to be integer!".
- The vignette is formatted with `BiocStyle`, has an Installation section, and
  uses subsections where it used `\paragraph{}`, which never rendered.
- `devtools` and `markdown` are dropped from `Suggests`. The vignette was the
  only thing that named them, and it no longer does.
- The example data is documented: what each of its three elements is, how
  `data-raw/cogaps_example.r` builds it, and the terms its sources are under.
- `Authors@R` gives each co-author one role rather than both `aut` and `ctb`,
  and names the funder of the work.

## friends.test 0.99.21

- Exported function names no longer contain dots, as the dot is reserved for S3
  dispatch: `friends.test()`, `friends.test.bic()`, `row.int.ranks()`,
  `unif.ks.test()`, `best.step.fit()`, `best.step.fit.bic()` and
  `step.fit.ln.likelihoods()` became `friends_test()`, `friends_test_bic()`,
  `row_int_ranks()`, `unif_ks_test()`, `best_step_fit()`, `best_step_fit_bic()`
  and `step_fit_ln_likelihoods()`. Argument names are unchanged.
- `step.fit.ln.likelihoods.fullmesh()` is no longer exported.
- `is()` is imported from `methods`.
- Source file names follow the function names, with the `.R` extension.

## friends.test 0.99.20

- Progress indicators are improved.
- Progress bars are switched off in parallel; purrr map does not work with BiocParallel and cli progress bar does not work.

## friends.test 0.99.19

- Parallel backend switched from mirai/purrr to BiocParallel (pass `BPPARAM` to both main functions; default is serial).
- The step-model likelihood search is rewritten from O(n_rows) to O(n_cols) per marker using a convexity argument, giving ~N00× speedup on large matrices.
- `step.fit.ln.likelihoods` return format changed: now returns a compact list instead of a full likelihood profile.
- Function wrap `step.fit.ln.likelihoods.fullmesh` returns the previous full-profile return format.

## friends.test 0.99.18

- We now return list of lists of 3-element vectors in both main functions.
- All the slow inner loops are now purrr::map-family based.
- Progress indicator and `.progress` parameter added.

- best.friends now returns data frame even when the return is empty.
- Tests added, docs improved.

## friends.test 0.99.11

- The function that fits models and the function that finds the best are separated.

## friends.test 0.99.10

## friends.test 0.99.8

- Added fields about the best step in the return.

## friends.test 0.99.7

- New functions appear for KS test of uniformity of ranks of a tag in different collection and for the likelihood of a step in the ranks (thanks to A. Kroshnin and A. Suvorikova).

- Create separate function for the first ranking.
- friends.test does not return the ranks any more.
